-- schema.sql uses UUID + SERIAL
-- Defines PostgreSQL tables for chat sessions, messages, and image analysis data.

-- A UUID is a 128-bit identifier that is globally unique.
-- It’s like a super-long ID that almost guarantees no two IDs are ever the same, anywhere in the world.
-- Commonly used in databases and distributed systems instead of simple numbers.
